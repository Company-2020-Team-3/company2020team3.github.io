		<h1>Game Development Process</h1>			
		<h4 class="subtitle">Game Development is challenging, yet potentially satisfying</h4>
		
		
		<p class="bio">
				Game Development is the process of creating a game! It involves many steps and requires many skills to create a sufficient final product			
		</p>				
		
	</div>	
	
	<div class="wrapper">		
  
		<h1>Step 1</h1>			
		<h4 class="subtitle">Design Phase</h4>
		
		
		<p class="bio">
				This is where you design your game, figure out your target audience, and determine what you will need to complete it!
				Some roles you will need are:
				- Programmer
				- Artist
				- Composer
				- Writer
				- Sound Design		
				You can either work together on a team, or try to go at it alone if you think you can satisfy these categories by yourself.
				Although working on a team can save time and energy, be prepared for less creative freedom (unless you are paying your team members for their efforts.) 
		</p>				
		
	</div>

	<div class="wrapper">		
  
		<h1>Step 2</h1>			
		<h4 class="subtitle">Prototyping</h4>
		
		
		<p class="bio">
				This is where the design for your game is finished, and you're starting to work on a small scale, fully functional protoype/demo.
				Once you reach this stage, DO NOT make changes to your original design!	
				A prototype aims to showcase the features of your game while being small in scale- yet polished.
		</p>				
		
	</div>

	<div class="wrapper">		
  
		<h1>Step 3</h1>			
		<h4 class="subtitle">Development</h4>
		
		
		<p class="bio">
				This is where you go on to expand your project to completion beyond the prototype.
				This process can take a really long time, years even- be persistent and don't give up!			
		</p>				
		
	</div>

	<div class="wrapper">		
  
		<h1>Step 4</h1>			
		<h4 class="subtitle">Deployment</h4>
		
		
		<p class="bio">
				This is where you release your game! Preparing beforehand to make sure your game is received well is vital.
				At this point there should be little to no bugs in your project so have thorough testing done beforehand.		
		</p>

		<h1>Conclusion</h1>			
		<h4 class="subtitle">That's all for now!</h4>
		
		
		<p class="bio">
				This guide on game development was very generalized, so if you're interested feel free to do some reasearch!
				Better yet, start developing a game today! Here are some great engines that you can try:

				Unity (Good for 2D or 3D, but not the best for 2D compared to other engines)
				https://unity.com/

				GameMaker Studio (Amazing for 2D games)
				https://www.yoyogames.com/get

				Godot (Also amazing for 2D games, much better UI system than GameMaker)
				https://godotengine.org/
