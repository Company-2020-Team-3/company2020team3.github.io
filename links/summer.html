			<br>Starry is an internet startup that focuses on bringing broadband to those who need it. This summer I worked at Starry as a Data Science intern. 
			<br>I've worked on a few projects there, but the main project I'm working on is confidential in nature. 
			<br>The main things I've utilized in my work there was: SQL, Python, QGIS, and Google Sheets.
			<br>Working at Starry has been an incredible experience so far and definitely made me step outside of my comfort zone as I had hoped. 
			<br>After this internship I'm certain I can take the things I've learned and look into additional projects on my own time to learn even more.

			<br>Concertio is a tech startup based in New York that specializes in optimization. This summer, I worked at Concertio as a Software Engineer intern. 
			<br>My task is to build an extension for the Microsoft Visual Studio Code that supports the main product of the company - Concertio Optimizer Studio. 
			<br>To do that, I had to learn a lot of new things: programming language TypeScript, VS Code Extension API, Optimizer Studio CLI, Optimizer Studio API, Jira, Bitbucket, and many more! 
			<br>I was involved in the design process, engineering, testing, and improving the extension for the best user experience. It was my first tech internship, and I'm so proud of the work I've done. 
			<br>This experience made me a better developer and a better professional.
